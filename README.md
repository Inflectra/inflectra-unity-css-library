# inflectra-unity-css-library
This library contains useful utility and other classes to provide flexible and consistent styling across Inflectra products, notably Spira and SpiraApps.

The utility class file contains classes for:

- color variables
- global resets
- padding
- margin
- borders
- positioning
- display modes
- flexbox
- typography
- cursors
- height
- width
- overflow
- images
- opacity
- z-index
- animations
- background colors
- colors
- shadows and effects
- media queries (for large, medium, small, and extra small screens)

## Utility classes
The classes and their progression should be relatively easy to follow and are very quick to use once you get the hang of them. They provide modular styling, with consistent sizing to both be incredibly flexible while also adding harmony to the final designs.

## Media queries
Only a certain subset of classes have full media query support. In particular margin and padding do. These queries can be extended over time to provide more complete support.
